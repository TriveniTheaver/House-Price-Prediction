# House Price Prediction

This is my first project that uses Machine Learning to predict house prices using the California Housing dataset.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a regression model that predicts house prices based on different features such as income, house age, and location.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Model
Linear Regression

## Evaluation Metrics
- R² Score
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)

## Output
The model predicts house prices and compares actual vs predicted values using visualization.
